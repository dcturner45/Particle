<b>Particle</b>

Particle (giving you the most important 'part' of an 'article' -> part + article = Particle) is an article summarizer for iOS. It allows the user to get an article's summary straight from Safari. To use particle once it's installed, just visit an online article in Safari, press the Share button (the one that looks like a box with an arrow coming out of it), and press Particle. If Particle is installed but doesn't show up, just press the "More" button and enable Particle. The article's summary will be displayed inline in Safari.

Unfortunately, Particle is not currently able to store summaries for later use. In iOS, storing the data from an action extension (which is the main function of Particle) to share it with an app requires the use of App Groups. App Groups in turn requires an Apple Developer account which costs $99 (which I didn't want to spend just for this project). 

Particle uses the free <a href="https://sentisum.3scale.net/">SentiSum API</a> to perform summarization. The API is limited to 50 requests (summarizations) per day.
